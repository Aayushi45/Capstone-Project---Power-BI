# Capstone-Project---Power-BI
This project involves designing a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to analyze key business metrics for an e-commerce retail dataset. The dashboard provides insights into sales performance, delayed orders, payment trends, product ratings, seasonal patterns, and revenue analysis to help optimize business decisions.

📊 Project Objectives<br/>

--Identify top-performing product categories based on total sales.<br/>
--Analyze delayed orders by category and monthly trends.<br/>
--Compare on-time vs. delayed orders to assess fulfillment efficiency.<br/>
--Evaluate customer payment preferences using visual insights.<br/>
--Determine highest and lowest-rated products for quality assessment.<br/>
--Conduct state-wise sales analysis to understand regional trends.<br/>
--Explore seasonal sales patterns for strategic forecasting.<br/>
--Perform yearly revenue analysis to identify business growth trends.<br/>

📂 Datasets Used<br/>

The analysis is based on multiple datasets, including:

--Orders: Details of customer purchases, delivery status, and timelines.<br/>
--Order Items: Breakdown of products purchased per order.<br/>
--Payments: Transaction details, including payment methods and amounts.<br/>
--Products: Product information, categories, and ratings.<br/>
--Customers & Geolocation: Customer demographics and regional data.<br/>
--Sellers: Information about merchants selling on the platform.<br/>
